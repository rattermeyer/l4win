# Quickinstall

Basically, we need the following software installed on Windows

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

This guide assumes, that you have installed these two already.

## Windows Preparation

Now you need to install several things using Chocolatey

```bash
choco install vagrant
choco install openssh
choco install microsoft-windows-terminal
choco install firacodenf
choco install vscode
choco install kube
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

You can use the `choco-install.bat` file in this directory.

## Linux VM setup

In this project directory, start provisioning the VM using:

```bash
    vagrant up
```

This will power up the Linux VM and configure it.

## Test it

You should be able to log in using

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

Please cancel your login attempt, because until windows terminal is not configured correctly, you will have problems with the config questions you are being asked.

Show your ssh-config using

```bash
vagrant ssh-config
```

This command prints out where your ssh private key file is located:

```bash
IdentityFile D:/noscan/git/l4win-dev/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
```

We need to set some permissions, so the private key file can be used for login (without password).
See this superuser [arcticle](https://superuser.com/a/1296046) for the right settings.

You should be able to login with your private key file as well:

```bash
ssh -i D:/noscan/git/l4win-dev/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key vagrant@192.168.2.2
```

Replacing the path with the path of your `IdentityFile`.

## Configure Windows Terminal

Open the "Windows Terminal" and settings and create a new profile ("Neues Profil hinzuf√ºgen")
![Profile](/doc/images/terminal01.png "adding new profile")

And enter the ssh command you tested above:

![Profile](/doc/images/terminal02.png "configuring new profile")

And change the font and choose the "FiraCode NF" font.

![Profile](/doc/images/terminal03.png "configuring font")

And save your changes

## Configure Linux VM

Open a new tab with the l4win profile.

You should be asked several questions. Configure it to your liking

### Personalize Git Config

You must set your name and email, so git can record this in the commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name Max Mustermann
git config --global user.email max.mustermann@mycompany.com
```

Replace name and email with your real ones, of course.

### Install Java and build tools

```bash
sdk install java
sdk install gradle
sdk install maven
```

### Install latest node lts version

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

## What is in the Box?

### Command Line

The shell of the vagrant user is configured to zsh.
The configurations are managed using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
The theme is using [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).
You can reconfigure p10k using `p10k configure`.

A lot of modern Linux command line tools are installed.

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): for handling json files
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq): for handling yaml files
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [silversearcher-ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (`ag` on the command line)
- htop: a modern top
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): an advanced cat
- [tldr](https://tldr.sh): an easy to consume man page alternative
- [httpie](https://httpie.io): curl for the modern json API age.
- [curlie](https://github.com/rs/curlie): similar to httpie
- [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd): modern `ls` replacement. An alias has been set from `ls` to `lsd`. It is CLI compatible with `ls`
- [broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot): easily navigate to all subdirs using `br`
- [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs): a modern ps
- [mcfly](https://github.com/cantino/mcfly): navigation of your shell history
- [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp): store tmux session manager

### Linux GUI apps

A `DISPLAY` variable is exported, that will support an X Server running on Windows, so you can easily start GUI apps, like IntelliJ from the command line.

### Programming Languages and Development Environment

The box is prepared for different languages / frameworks

- Java (using sdkman)
- node (using nvm)
- Python3 (including pylint)
- golang

#### Java IDE

If you need an IDE for development, you can use Intellij.
This requires an X Server on Windows.
Intellij is installed at /opt/intellij

### Git support

#### Git commit message template

Git is installed and an opinionated configuration has been provided.
This includes the use of a `gitmessage` template to push better commit messages.
It configures [Vim](https://www.vim.org) as the editor.
If you use git from the command line or tig, this git commit template will be displayed.

#### Credential Store

It configures a credential store.
You should therefore not use your general password, but only personal access tokens for authentication against a git server (github, GitLab or Bitbucket).

#### Diff and Merge

The configuration defines [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) as the diff filter.

And uses [meld](https://meldmerge.org) as the mergetool.
This requires a running X Server on Windows.

#### Git Guis

Different CLI GUIs are installed

- [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig)
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

### Docker and Kubernetes

The VM contains the [k3s](https://k3s.io) Kubernetes distribution.
The kubeconfig for this cluster is linked from `.kube/config`.

You can use the cli tool [`k9s`](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) to get an overview of the cluster.

With a running X Server on Windows you can also use the  [`lens`](https://k8slens.dev) kubernetes IDE to explore your cluster(s).

Lens could also be used on Windows, if you mount the k3s samba and map it to a drive letter.

We have also `docker` and `podman` available on the VM.

You can scan images using `trivy`(https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) and explore images using [`dive`](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive).

To deploy for example a Kubernetes cluster, simply follow the strimzi instructions and run:

```bash
kubectl create namespace kafka
kubectl create -f 'https://strimzi.io/install/latest?namespace=kafka' -n kafka
kubectl apply -f https://strimzi.io/examples/latest/kafka/kafka-persistent-single.yaml -n kafka 
kubectl wait kafka/my-cluster --for=condition=Ready --timeout=300s -n kafka 
kubectl -n kafka run kafka-producer -ti --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:0.26.0-kafka-3.0.0 --rm=true --restart=Never -- bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic
```

... here you can write message, e.g. hello, world! that can be received by the consumer

```bash
kubectl -n kafka run kafka-consumer -ti --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:0.26.0-kafka-3.0.0 --rm=true --restart=Never -- bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic --from-beginning
```

## File exchange

The Linux box provides two shares

- vagrant (home)
- k3s

We assume, that the IP of your VM (see Vagrantfile) is 192.168.110.3, then you can mount it in Windows as:

```cmd
net use z: \\192.168.110.3\k3s /User:vagrant
net use x: \\192.168.110.3\vagrant /User:vagrant
```
